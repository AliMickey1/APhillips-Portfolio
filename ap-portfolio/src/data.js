        "Hackathon Challenge: Our project was inspired by the pressing need to uphold the integrity of our elections amidst rising concerns about voter suppression, unregulated campaign spending, partisan gerrymandering, and the pervasive spread of misinformation. We aimed to create a solution that leverages the principles of gamification to engage and empower the public, helping to restore confidence in the democratic process. By integrating game design elements, such as badges, leaderboards, and quizzes, we sought to motivate and inspire individuals to actively participate in the election process, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.",
